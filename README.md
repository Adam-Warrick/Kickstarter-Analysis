# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview and purpose of Project

My task for this project was to analyze Kickstarter Data to uncover pertinent information and trends for new kickstarter client. The purpose of this analysis is to understand how different campaigns did compared to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

I have performed my analysis in Excel using a variety of Tables, charts, formulas in order to uncover needed information from this data set. The challenge in this data set was to make sure the data prepared made sense to the consumer to make accurate and informed decisions. Based on the charts below, the client has clear and concise data with visible trends.

## Results

- Based on my analysis of launch dates it has been determined that the best time to launch is May to July which are higher then all other months. The worst time to launch is November and December. The Successful data line follows a similar trend to the failure line, but at a higher level. 

- The analysis concludes that the most successful goals were under $5,000. 100% of the goals failed from $45,000-$49,000.

- Current limitations to this data set is that the data only goes to 2017. We don't have any new data to support our analysis. Having current data would help support our decisions within a more relative timeframe. 

- We can use a box and whiskers plot to help determine if there are any outliers and if the Mean is skewed. This would also give us a better understanding of what data lives within Q1 and Q3 quartiles.
